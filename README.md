Isso – Ich schrei sonst
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/posativ/isso.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/posativ/isso)

You love static blog generators (especially [Acrylamid][1] *cough*) and the
only option to interact with your community is [Disqus][2]. There's nothing
wrong with it, but if you care about the privacy of your audience you are
better off with a comment system that is under your control. This is, where
Isso comes into play.
