Isso â€“ a commenting server similar to Disqus
============================================

This **fork** of Isso adds possibility to login using OpenID,
Facebook, or Google. The user's name and profile picture is then
fetched and used for the comment for a more personal feel, and those
comments are authenticated so that the author can prove that he/she
wrote the comment.

Brief setup instructions for the additional features of this fork
follows below. For all other questions, see the
[web site of the main Isso project](https://posativ.org/isso/).

Facebook
--------

To enable Facebook login, you must first create a Facebook App by
visiting [Facebook for Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/)
and choosing `My Apps->Add a New App`. Set `Site URL` to the URL of
your web site where Isso is embedded (not the URL or port where Isso
itself listens). Then take note of the `App ID` and `App Secret` that
Facebook has generated for your app, and add the following settings to
your Isso configuration file:

    [facebook]
    enabled = true
    app-id = <Your App ID>
    app-secret = <Your App Secret>

Google
--------

To enable Google login, you must first create a Google App by visiting
the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and
choosing `Create Project`. Under `Credentials`, choose `Create
Credentials->OAuth client ID`. Then take note of the `Client ID` that
Google has generated for you, and add the following settings to your
Isso configuration file:

    [google]
    enabled = true
    client-id = <Your Client ID>
