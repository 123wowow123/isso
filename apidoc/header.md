# Introduction

This is the API documentation of the Isso commenting system.

For more information about Isso, visit **[posativ.org/isso](https://posativ.org/isso)**
or check out the source at **[GitHub](https://github.com/posativ/isso)**.

### Conventions

This documenation uses `https://comments.example.com` as the base URL for Isso's API.

For your installation, this URL will be different. Make sure to substitute the
example URL for the URL you load your `embed.min.js` from.

E.g. `https://example.com/isso/js/embed.min.js` would result in a base URL of
`https://example.com/isso`.
